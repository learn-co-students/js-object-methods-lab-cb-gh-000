u# Object Methods in JS Lab

## Objectives
+ Create constructor functions
+ Add methods to a constructor function
+ Create objects from a constructor function

## Instructions
We're tutoring a high school student in U.S. History, and they have to memorize all the U.S. presidents (and relevant information). We want to make studying fun, so the plan is to build a little app to help quiz them. For now, we're just going to build out the database.

In `index.js`, build an ES6 `President` class with the following properties set by the constructor: `name`, `politicalParty`, `yearsInOffice`, and `homeState`.

Add following methods to the class:
+ `veto` — returns `NO!`

+ `passBill` — returns `You can do that!`

+ `doCharity` — returns `I like to help people.`

+ `conductPressInterview` — returns `I am proud to be an American.`

+ `sayHi` — returns `Hi, my name is <name>. I am from <homestate>. I represent the <politicalParty>s, and was in office <yearsInOffice>.`

Then create the following presidents: George Washington, Abraham Lincoln, Richard Nixon, and Jimmy Carter.
